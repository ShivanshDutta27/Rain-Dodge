# Rain-Dodge
Description:
Rain Dodge is an action-based 2D game where the player must dodge falling obstacles while collecting coins. The player starts with three lives, and the game progressively increases in difficulty as the speed of falling obstacles accelerates. The objective is to avoid collisions with obstacles and maximize coin collection for the highest possible score.

Core Features:

Player Movement: The player controls the character using arrow keys or WASD to move left, right, up, and down within the game window.
Obstacles: Randomly generated obstacles fall from the top of the screen. Colliding with an obstacle reduces the player's life.
Coin Collection: Collectible coins are scattered across the screen. The player earns points by collecting them.
Speed Scaling: As the player progresses, the game speed increases based on a mathematical function, enhancing difficulty.
Lives System: The player starts with three lives, which decrease upon collision with an obstacle. Losing all lives results in game over.
Game Over Condition: If the player loses all three lives, the game ends, and the score is displayed.
